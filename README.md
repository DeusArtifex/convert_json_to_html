# convert_json_to_html
Very generic json2html converter

## Required to run
To run this, you'll need json2html on your machine.

It can be installed via pip:

	pip install json2html
				
Or from the project website: [json2html](https://pypi.org/project/json2html/ "json2html")

## Usage

	convert_json_to_html.py [path_to_json_file]

As for now, the script converts your json file to html with the same name as the .json provided to the script file. Output file is generated in the same directory as the script. Both these things may may change in the future and if so, README will be updated.

Have a pleasant day.
